       The first time you run a program under "use Acme::Pony",
       the module removes all that nasty text stuff from your
       source file, turning it into a lovely ASCII-art rendition
       of a pony.  In the spirit of other london.pm modules, the
       ASCII-art will consist entirely of the characters matching
       /[buffy]+/i, thus fulfilling Greg, Leon and Dave's fantasy
       of seeing Buffy riding a Pony.

       ""Can't pony '%s'""
           Acme::Pony couldn't access the source file for
           modification.

       ""Can't unpony '%s'""
           Acme::Pony couldn't access the source file for
           execution.

       This is based on Leon Brocard's 'Buffy' module and
       inspired by Damian Conway's brief talk on his Bleach
       module.

       Leon contributed the code for scaling a vector Pony and
       filling it, replacing the bitmap Pony from the previous
       versions.
